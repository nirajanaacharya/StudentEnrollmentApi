First i followed the standard approach for creating the Crud App using the standard db context 
added the migration and updated the database using the ef update 
registered the model in the program.cs first
Created the user Model for identity Db creates the roles without specifying the getter setter
Then Switched to identityDbcontext for the Authentication and user roles to be more convenient for the jwt and authorization
Registered the db context for the dependency injection 
Then created the Dto named Login and Register for the login and registration for Authentication 
Created the Authentication Controller to generate the jwt token
Specified the Authentication Module in the program cs using asp's Authentication 
Then tested the authentication and token generation using the Postmen
To make the conntroller thin , i created the services and reduced the controller workload to just routing the api not talking with the database as well
Then added the Global exception handler for the System with it's own Dto as well 
But i had some difficulty during setting the swagger ui for the authorization as i used the StudentApi module's Model but the new version doesn't support that 
That took me quite a time to figure it out 
Then After that i tested my app in the browser via swagger and it worked perfectly
